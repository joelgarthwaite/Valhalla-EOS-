## KEY METRICS & CALCULATIONS

### Production Capacity Requirements

**Case Assembly:**
- 1 operative produces 70 cases per 7-hour day
- 220 working days per year per operative
- Annual capacity per operative: 15,400 cases
- **2029 requirement:** 200,000 cases = 15-16 operatives (with buffer)

**UV Printing:**
- 1 machine + 1 operative produces 190 printed cases per day
- 220 working days per year
- Annual capacity per machine: 41,800 cases
- **2029 requirement:** 160,000 cases (80% of 200K) = 4 UV machines
- **Staffing:** 2-3 UV operatives can manage 4 machines

**2026 Production Needs:**
- 42,000 cases = 3 assembly operatives (minimum)
- 33,600 UV printed cases (80%) = 1 UV machine (current capacity 41,800)
- **Action:** Purchase second UV machine in 2026 for redundancy and 2027 growth

### Revenue Growth Trajectory

| Year | Revenue | Growth Rate | Customers |
|------|---------|-------------|-----------|
